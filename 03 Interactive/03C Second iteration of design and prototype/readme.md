## 03C Second iteration of design and prototype

<br>
I made some modifications, and decided to have four separate graphs to show the differences and similarities between each parameters instead of only using one geospacial graph.

If the users hover on the images, it will show the tooltip with more information, and if the users click on the images, it will jump to the original website.

If the users switch between different parameters, ideally there will be smooth transitions between these graphs.
