## 02C Second iteration of design and prototype

<br>



I fetched all data related to "Anonymous" in Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum through the API. Then I manually cleaned up all the data,  [data.json](https://github.com/kanodesu/majorstudio-fall21/blob/main/02%20Qualitative/02C%20Second%20iteration%20of%20design%20and%20prototype/data.json).

I changed the structure of the whole website, and had a vertical scrolling wensite for now with a lot of storytelling techniques.

After the critique with my classmates and professfor, I decided to have a scatter plot graph with all the images of the anonymous gifts in Cooper Hewitt. Instead of using the dots, I will have the thumbnails of the objects, and if you click on the thumbnails, it will link to the original Cooper Hewitt website. On the x-axis, it will the dates, and on the y-axis, it will be the places where the gifts were from.
