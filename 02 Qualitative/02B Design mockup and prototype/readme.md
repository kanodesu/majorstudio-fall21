## 02B Design mockup and prototype

I chose the Gift of Anonymous Donor as my topic to continue working on, to visualize the objects/artworks in Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum that were donated by Anonymous donors. 

For the homepage, I got a super big title with the word "Anonymous" being covered by an orange brick to hide it, and to keep mysterious side of Anonymous donors. When users hovering on it, it will show the original orange text.
