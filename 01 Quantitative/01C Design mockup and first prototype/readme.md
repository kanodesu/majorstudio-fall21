## 01C Design mockup and first prototype

Since I received a lot of comments on the concepts and the dataset I chose was too qualitative than quantitative from week, I decided to re-consider about the concept and the dataset I will use.

After I did the research again, I decided to compare the width, length and the size of the paintings which are on the exhibition in Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery.

#### Rough sketch:
