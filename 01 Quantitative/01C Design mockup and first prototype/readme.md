## 01C Design mockup and first prototype

Since I received a lot of comments on the concepts and the dataset I chose was too qualitative than quantitative from week, I decided to re-consider about the concept and the dataset I will use.

After I did the research again, I decided to compare the width, length and the size of the paintings which are on the exhibition in Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery.

#### Rough sketch:

The final output will have 150 dots on the graph, with some other visualizations on the side. Because this version looks like an info-graphic, I also tried the vertical one to let the audience have a experience of scrolling down a website.

#### Dataï¼š
I also have the `json` file with all the data I needed by accessing the Smithsonian API. [data.json](https://github.com/kanodesu/majorstudio-fall21/blob/main/01%20Quantitative/01C%20Design%20mockup%20and%20first%20prototype/data.json)
